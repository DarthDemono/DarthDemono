<h1>Well, hello there! My name is Jubair Hasan (Joy) AKA DarthDemono. I’m a Fortinet Certified Associate and a writer of sorts.</h1>

My journey with the world of Internet Technology has existed since the very beginning of my life. In a few short years, I transitioned from playing with small cell phones and watching box televisions into the realm of smartphones. My inquisitive nature led me to explore whatever I touched. I remember accidentally bricking my dad’s Galaxy J7 while attempting to gain root access, and obviously, I got the punishment I deserved. I also completely broke down the PC to its bare circuits. Curiosity killed the cat, but satisfaction brought it back.

As I grew up, the thirst for knowledge grew, and I started learning everything that piqued my interest. YouTube is a great source of knowledge. I started learning from channels like Linus Tech Tips, Techquickie, Half as Interesting, etc. When my mother finally got a laptop in 2019, that’s when my learning skyrocketed.

My first foray into programming involved learning Python. It started after I got inspired by a Discord bot in rSlash’s server. I decided I needed my own. I learned Python, I learned loops, I learned to utilize Discord, YouTube, and Instagram APIs. Due to my low PC specs, I coded in Notepad and IDLE of all text editors. When I was allowed to get upgrades, I picked stronger tools like Atom and then VSCode.

Continuing my quest for knowledge, I created and hosted my first website using GitHub Pages. I experimented with microformats such as JSON-LD and vCards to enrich the website's metadata and Search Engine Optimization. When my thirst for knowledge in this subject was quenched, I gained a new interest. I created a music library with a very high amount of metadata. For the metadata, I used MusicBrainz—an online database for music metadata. This eventually led to the creation of my terminal Python app, Spotipython.

Around 2023, my journey of gaining knowledge gained momentum exponentially. After I lost an argument, I started learning logic, logical fallacies, biases, and psychological effects. A game like Europa Universalis IV led me to learn Political Theory and Ideologies. The discovery of YouTubers such as NetworkChuck and Fireship encouraged me to pursue Networking, Cybersecurity, and Ethical Hacking.

Soon, a need for validation of my skills grew. I published my projects on GitHub. I started doing online courses on Networking and Cybersecurity, and I began taking exams in these fields. Currently, I hold 45 Certificates from esteemed institutions like Cisco Networking Academy, I.B.M. SkillsBuild, Fortinet Training Institute, and Great Learning. These certificates display my skills in theoretical knowledge of Networking, Cybersecurity, Digital Marketing (SEO, SEM, Social Media Marketing), Web Development (HTML, CSS, PHP), and Coding (Python, C).

I am an alumnus of Bangladesh Elementary School and graduated with a perfect GPA of 5.00 in SSC in 2022. I continued my academic journey at Halishahar Cantonment Public School & College.

Currently, I'm contributing as a Content Writer, Marketing Agent, Web Developer, and LinkedIn Manager at Agamir Hashi.
